            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Have you ever wondered how files get managed and edited over time without the complications of team members interfering with one another? Well, It all begins with a version control. A version control is a system constructed for when various project files need be monitored and tracked by the team working on them. For example, a developer can manage, revise, and make adjustments to the files, while the VCS records the time and date, which particular user made the revisions, and what makes them different from the past data. Some beneficial aspects are, restricts data from being overwritten, former versions of files are kept, and it is all managed in a common repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Now that we know what a version control system, there are different types of systems like distributed, local data, and client-server. A widely used one is called GIT. GIT is a fast, open source, distributed VCS designed to have multiple local branches that can work independently of each other.One useful attribute GIT has is that it allows users to have their copy of a repository on their private physical computer. Meaning, if a specific version of a file remains unchanged, GIT will link it to the original/previous file it was attained from. This process keeps the VCS running smooth and error free.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">On a physical level, imagine you are in a gigantic warehouse where millions of files are stored and logged for daily use. GIT uses a   very similar storage facility named a repository. Repositories are often located in the subdirectory of the main file; there is where it stores and tracks all of its accumulated data. There two types of repositories, local and remote. A local repository will work in one of two ways. It can create a brand new repository apart from the main one, or clone the existing remote one into your private computer. Then there are remote repositories. This version will be hosted through an online network and shared among peers working on the same files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three primary positions where GIT stores your files. Modified, committed, and staged.The most widely used state is commit, this process safely records the changes done to a file in its repository, whether it is local or remote. Further one, to modify means a user has changed something within that file, but it has not committed to saving in the repository. Lastly, you have the staged state. Staging means a user is preparing the files and getting ready to commit. For example, if you were only able to finish modifying only half of your files, you are allowed for staging and completing your work at another time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">SSH</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">SSH, short for Secure Shell is a network protocol that allows a secure entry for administrators to access a remote computer or repository. In GIT, when using a repository other than it's own, you would need to use SSH access instead of using the https protocol to identify secure trusted computers. Also, a small benefit of using SSH keys is you can bypass entering your password for each system. The process is quite simple; you would need to grab the SSH public key from the remote repository and configure it in the terminal for the local repository. In the terminal writing out the "add ." will move the final files into staging mode. Lastly, using "commit -m" will finalize  changed to the local repository.</p>
